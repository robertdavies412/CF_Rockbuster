Here is a SQL query to identify descriptive statistics using aggregate functions to answer common questions on key business metrics:

SELECT MIN(release_year) AS min_release_year, MAX(release_year) AS max_release_year, ROUND (AVG(release_year), 0) AS avg_release_year,	
       MIN(rental_duration) AS min_rental_duration, MAX(rental_duration) AS max_rental_duration, ROUND (AVG(rental_duration), 2) AS avg_rental_duration,
       MIN(rental_rate) AS min_rental_rate, MAX(rental_rate) AS max_rental_rate, ROUND (AVG(rental_rate), 2) AS avg_rental_rate,
       MIN(length) AS min_length, MAX(length) AS max_length, ROUND (AVG(length), 2) AS avg_length,
       MIN(replacement_cost) AS min_replacement_cost, MAX(replacement_cost) AS max_replacement_cost, ROUND (AVG(replacement_cost), 2) AS avg_replacement_cost,
       MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY last_update) AS last_update_modal_value,
       MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rating) AS rating_modal_value
FROM   film;
