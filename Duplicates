Here is a SQL query for identifying duplicates in a table:

SELECT          title,
                release_year,
                language_id,
                rental_duration,
                rental_rate,
                length,
                replacement_cost,
                rating,
                COUNT(*)
FROM            film
GROUP BY        title,
                release_year,
                language_id,
                rental_duration,
                rental_rate,
                length,
                replacement_cost,
                rating
HAVING COUNT(*) >1;
