Here is a SQL query using Joins to identify the top 10 countries with the most Rockbuster customers and their respective customer counts:

SELECT 	   country.country,
           COUNT(customer.customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM   	   customer
INNER JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
INNER JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
GROUP BY   country
ORDER BY   COUNT(customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10;
