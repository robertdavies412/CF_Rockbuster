Here is a SQL statement using a subquery to identify the average amount paid by Rockbuster's top 10 customers ranked by revenue:

SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_amount_paid.total_paid), 2) AS average_amount_paid
FROM
    (SELECT     customer.customer_id,
                customer.first_name,
                customer.last_name,
                country.country,
                city.city,
                SUM(payment.amount) AS total_paid
    FROM        payment	
    INNER JOIN  customer ON payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id
    INNER JOIN  address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
    INNER JOIN  city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
    INNER JOIN  country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
    GROUP BY    customer.customer_id, country.country, city.city, payment.amount
    ORDER BY    total_paid DESC
    LIMIT 10)   AS total_amount_paid;
